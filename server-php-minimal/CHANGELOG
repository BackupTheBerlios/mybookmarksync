0.2.1 (released on http://developer.berlios.de/projects/mybookmarksync/ 01.11.2003)
  - more extensive and more user friendly debugging via new debug.php page.
    After authentification (please change the current password 'secret' to
    something really secret) the current debug.log is displayed together
    with the current logging state (logging enabled or disabled).

    A button toggles the logging state, another button refreshes the page
    (to show new log entries) and with the truncate button it is possible
    (after confirmation) to flush all log entries.
  - Fixed SF bugs 830173 and 823312 (URLs containing quotes couldn't
    inserted into the database.
  - Fixed reg.php:SF Bug 817537 (REGEDIT4 and no trailing slash for root)
    Blank line after copyright block broke header modification.
  - All unnecessary tables and fields of the remaining tables in
    bookmarksync.sql were removed (to make it minimal).
  - Added new database table syncit_config which stores configuration
    params. (currently used for debug output only, but other params like
    master password etc. should be stored here)
